# ðŸ§  Machine Learning Algorithm from Scratch

> *This repo contains clean, from scratch implementations of core machine learning algorithms using **only NumPy**. Each algorithm is organized in its own folder with a Jupyter Notebok explaining the logic, training process and results.

## ðŸ“– Overview

This project demonstrates a from-scratch implementation of the *[algorithm name]* (e.g., Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, KNN, etc.).  
No ML libraries are used â€” only *NumPy* and standard Python.

This is intended to:
- Understand the math behind the algorithm
- Learn how training actually happens under the hood
- Visualize predictions and model performance

---

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack

- Python 3.10+
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualization)
- Jupyter Notebook / .py script

---


## ðŸŒŸ Features

- [x] Data preprocessing
- [x] Manual implementation of [algorithm]
- [x] Custom loss function
- [x] Model evaluation (RMSE / Accuracy / Confusion Matrix)
- [x] Train-test split and validation
- [x] Visualization of results
- [x] No ML libraries (pure NumPy)

## ðŸ§  Training

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Epochs | [e.g., 1000] |
| Learning Rate | [e.g., 0.01] |
| Loss Function | [e.g., MSE / Binary Cross-Entropy] |
| Optimizer | [Custom / Gradient Descent] |

## â–¶ How to Run

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vaibhavi089/ml-algo-from-scratch.git
cd ml-algo-from-scratch

# If using Jupyter
jupyter notebook your_notebook.ipynb

# Or run the Python script
python train.py

```

## ðŸ”® Future Work

- Add regularization (L1 and L2) to prevent overfitting.
- Implement additional algorithms (e.g., SVM, Decision Trees, Naive Bayes).
- Extend the framework to support mini-batch and stochastic gradient descent.
- Add interactive UI using Streamlit or Gradio.
- Optimize matrix operations for larger datasets.
- Write unit tests for model reliability.
- Package the codebase into an installable Python package.
