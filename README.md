## ðŸ“– Overview

This project demonstrates a from-scratch implementation of the *[algorithm name]* (e.g., Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, KNN, etc.).  
No ML libraries are used â€” only *NumPy* and standard Python.

This is intended to:
- Understand the math behind the algorithm
- Learn how training actually happens under the hood
- Visualize predictions and model performance

---

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack

- Python 3.10+
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualization)
- Jupyter Notebook / .py script

---

## ðŸ“Š Dataset

- *Name:* [Dataset name, e.g., Boston Housing, Iris, Kaggle dataset]
- *Size:* [Samples Ã— Features]
- *Source:* [Kaggle / UCI link]

#### Example:
> Dataset: California Housing Dataset  
> Task: Predict house prices based on 8 features like rooms, location, etc.  
> Type: Supervised Regression

## ðŸŒŸ Features

- [x] Data preprocessing
- [x] Manual implementation of [algorithm]
- [x] Custom loss function
- [x] Model evaluation (RMSE / Accuracy / Confusion Matrix)
- [x] Train-test split and validation
- [x] Visualization of results

## â–¶ How to Run

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ml-algo-from-scratch.git
cd ml-algo-from-scratch

# If using Jupyter
jupyter notebook your_notebook.ipynb

# Or run the Python script
python train.py

---

## Future work
- Add regularization(L1/L2)
- Add support for multiple algorithms
- Build simple UI to demo predictions
