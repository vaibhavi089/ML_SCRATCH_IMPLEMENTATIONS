## ðŸ“– Overview

This project demonstrates a from-scratch implementation of the *[algorithm name]* (e.g., Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, KNN, etc.).  
No ML libraries are used â€” only *NumPy* and standard Python.

This is intended to:
- Understand the math behind the algorithm
- Learn how training actually happens under the hood
- Visualize predictions and model performance

---

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack

- Python 3.10+
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualization)
- Jupyter Notebook / .py script

---

## ðŸ“Š Dataset

- *Name:* [Dataset name, e.g., Boston Housing, Iris, Kaggle dataset]
- *Size:* [Samples Ã— Features]
- *Source:* [Kaggle / UCI link]

#### Example:
> Dataset: California Housing Dataset  
> Task: Predict house prices based on 8 features like rooms, location, etc.  
> Type: Supervised Regression
